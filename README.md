Buggy Bits Core is a series of tutorials for learning how to debug memory/CPU/crash bugs in your .NET Core applications. It is based on [Tess Ferrandez's](https://twitter.com/TessFerrandez) [.NET DebuggingÂ Demos](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tess/2008/02/04/net-debugging-demos-information-and-setup-instructions/), taken as-is (with her permission), and upgraded with code and instructions that work on .NET Core 2.0 on all supported development platforms.

These demos and instructions are specifically for .NET Core 2.0 on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For the .NET Framework for Windows, follow [Tess's original blog series](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tess/2008/02/04/net-debugging-demos-information-and-setup-instructions/).

To run the application, simply clone the repository and run `dotnet run` from "src/BuggyBits".
